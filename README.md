# Devlog Entry - 11/14/2024
## Roles
Garrett Blake as Tools Lead  
Sunny Han as Engine Lead  
Katrina VanArsdale as Design Lead  
Lia Cui as Assistant to Enging and Design  

## Tools and Materials
### Engines, libraries, frameworks
Phaser 3 
### Programming languages
We will be using Phaser 3 API along with JavaScript as Phaser is a web-based game engine. Consequently, because we are using a web-based game engine we will also be using HTML and CSS albeit very minimally. On the likely chance that we wil use Sprite Atlases, we will likely also use JSON to organize sprite atlas information. Moving forward in our alternate platform, we would like to switch the main programming language from JavaScript to TypeScript.
### Tools
The main IDE for writing code that we will all use is Visual Studio Code which we are all comfortable with. With visual assets, there are a variety of possibilities but it is very likely that Aseprite will be used for pixel art and sprites. We all know how to make pixel art and can do art to some degree so any art program is comfortable for us to use. For version control, we are also using GitHub because that is the expected version control tool.
### Alternate Platform
Our alternate primary programming language is TypeScript which supports web functionality but with stricter types. Phaser 3 should support TypeScript which means we can still use Phaser 3 to build our game.

## Outlook
Our team is hoping to make a project of reasonable scope that we feel that can be accomplished giving the time frame and available resources. The hardest anticipated part of this project is switching frameworks and getting comfortable in both languages. We are hoping to expand our understanding of creating clean, readable, and scalable code in a team setting.
